# üêâ FingerOfGod: Smiting the Boundaries of DeFi on Sonic

FingerOfGod is a next-generation DeFi protocol on the Sonic blockchain. Inspired by the successes of Snake.finance and HandOfGod, it introduces pegged tokens (fogHOG and fogSNAKE) and a governance token (FOG), enabling users to earn rewards via Genesis Pools, yield farming, and an elastic supply mechanism. The protocol aims to maintain a balanced and sustainable ecosystem through a combination of on-chain governance and automated treasury functions.

## Open-Source & Licensing Philosophy

At FingerOfGod, we proudly release our code as open source‚Äîavailable for everyone to review, use, and build upon. Our implementation of the ‚Äúharvest on Sonic‚Äù feature is based on common DeFi practices and open standards, ensuring that innovation in this space remains accessible and collaborative.

We strongly believe that the open-source ethos is key to advancing the DeFi ecosystem. While Snake Finance has claimed that our code uses their licensed implementation, it‚Äôs important to note that the specific harvest mechanism we employ is a widely adopted practice in the community. Our approach is built on transparent, community-driven standards‚Äînot proprietary restrictions.

We remain committed to delivering an open, free, and innovative protocol for everyone. We invite you to review our code on GitHub, contribute, and join us in building a more accessible DeFi future.
